           Full-stack project developed for an online store. The project uses Clean architecture.  
           The server side is based on ASP.NET using various design patterns. I used Entity Framework Core to interact with the Postgres Sql database.
           To develop the client side, I used React. Redux Toolkit to interact with the server. React Query for state management and Docker for containerization
